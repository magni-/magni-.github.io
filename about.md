Hi! I'm Paul Padier. By day, I'm a software engineer at [Rainforest QA][rainforest], working on the tester product team and writing mainly Ruby in a Rails application. Before that, I was at [Venmo][venmo], where I wrote Python for the Django backend. In my spare programming time at night, I like to dabble in other languages. As of late, these have been Rust and Haskell.
